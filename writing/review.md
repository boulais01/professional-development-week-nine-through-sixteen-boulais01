# Assessment Overview

Answer all of the following questions in the specified fashion. Please
note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository has a passing
build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have adequately answered
all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to each of them.

Please make sure that you remove all of the `TODO` markers and prompts
from this document. The final version of this document should primarily contain
the content that you wrote in response to the provided prompts.

Please note that you are invited to provide responses to all of these
questions as a part of your **Professional Development** grade in this course.
It is important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory answers to all
of these questions you will not earn a satisfactory assessment for one or more
