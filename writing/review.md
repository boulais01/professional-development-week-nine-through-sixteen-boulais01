# Assessment Overview

Answer all of the following questions in the specified fashion. Please
note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository has a passing
build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have adequately answered
all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to each of them.

Please make sure that you remove all of the `TODO` markers and prompts
from this document. The final version of this document should primarily contain
the content that you wrote in response to the provided prompts.

Please note that you are invited to provide responses to all of these
questions as a part of your **Professional Development** grade in this course.
It is important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory answers to all
of these questions you will not earn a satisfactory assessment for one or more
parts of the assessment of your work in the professional development category.

Finally, please note that you cannot "spend a token" in order to receive the
opportunity to revise and request a reassessment of the work in this repository.

### Professional Development Reflection

#### What is software engineering? How is software engineering is different than programming?

Software engineering, as has been answered in the past, is different from
programming in size and complexity. More specifically, software engineering is
generally for projects that last longer and are used in more places/ways than a
program would be.

#### How does knowledge of software engineering better equip you to be a leader in the Department of Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College?

Better knowledge of software engineering includes a better understanding of
leadership, due to the larger scale. As such, it better equips students to be
leaders by virtue of informing them on decision-making and group work.

#### How does knowledge of software engineering better equip you to secure an internship or a full-time position in either industry or graduate school?

At the very least, this class offers an example of employment, though a far more
difficult one than you would find in an internship or job due to the workload of
a full work-week without that much time to work on it. I don't know that it would
do much for securing those positions, though.

#### What is one insight from the "Software Engineering at Google" book that you have applied to your practice of software engineering? What happened when you applied this insight?

The Unit Testing chapter provides some good insights for me personally that I
was able to apply at least a little in my work during the course of this class,
in determining how to approach testing.

#### What is one practice from the "Software Engineering at Google" book that enabled you to become a more joy-filled software engineer?

Perhaps the style guides, though those were implemented before we even read the
associated chapter. 

#### From the perspective of professional development and the content in the "Software Engineering at Google" book, what is the greatest weakness of your software engineering team? Why? How would you advise the team to improve?

I would say that style guides are a weak point. People were simply disinclined
to follow them, or ignored them, and I will admit that I don't know why. The
implementation of the pre-commit feature, thanks to Simon, will hopefully reduce
that issue, although the templates created previously regarding pull requests
were frequently ignored as well. 

#### From the perspective of professional development and the content in the "Software Engineering at Google" book, what is your greatest weakness? Why? How do you plan to improve after the completion of this course?

My greatest weakness is probably either documentation or testing, but since I am
now seeing ways to improve my testing I would say documentation. I tend to
either over or underexplain, especially since I can't really add explanations
during my process of creating code because of the way I code. It tends to be
something I do afterwards, if I do it at all, and though in the past when I have
done it it has been acceptable, it's not something I do consistently. In truth,
I'm also not sure how to improve it. The place where I've been interning, when
I worked on the code, I found little to no explanation on any of it, and had to
simply read through it on my own to figure it out, so there isn't much of a
documentation culture there, though I did mark my changes with my name, the
date, and for some of them the reason as well. 

### Lessons Learned in Professional Development

TODO: Write one sentence to summarize what you have learned about each skill in
the area of professional development for software engineering. Each sentence
that you write should be accompanied by at least one reference that supports
your summarization. While you are encouraged to cite content from the "Software
Engineering at Google" book, it is acceptable for you to cite any source
available online. Please make sure that every reference that you provide is to a
web site link that the instructor can reference. Ultimately, you can think of
the sentence that you write as advice that you would give to a student at the
start of the next edition of the Software Engineering course.

TODO: Make sure that you delete all of the prompts in the following sections.

#### Team Work

I learned nothing new, but the refreshers are always good.

#### Project Management

The note about scaling and knowing what to fail/delegate was good information
to me.

- [Software Engineering](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch06.html)

#### Style Guides

I learned how to create style guides, with the emphasis on the why.
- [Software Engineering](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch08.html)

#### Effective Communication

While I generally do a lot of communicating, I could stand to clarify my own
processes more than I do.
- [Software Engineering](https://abseil.io/resources/swe-book/html/ch03.html)

#### Knowledge Sharing

I ought to write better documentation.
